# Detection Library

**3,057 detection rules** for OpenSearch / Wazuh Indexer, one YAML file each.

Rules are filed by **the log source their query actually reads** — the `data_win_system_eventID`,
Windows channel, or `data_*` field family the search filters on. Not by tactic, not by threat name.
If you know which telemetry you have onboarded, you know exactly which folders are live for you,
and every rule has exactly one home.

## Where to start

Pick the folder matching the telemetry you collect. The three that carry most of the value:

| If you have… | Go to | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sysmon | [`eid_01_process_creation`](./eid_01_process_creation/) — process creation, the richest single source | 1496 |
| PowerShell logging | [`eid_4104_script_block_logging`](./eid_4104_script_block_logging/) — de-obfuscated script text | 250 |
| Windows audit policy | [`security_eventlog`](./security_eventlog/) — logon, account and object access auditing | 141 |

| [`eid_12_13_14_registry_events`](./eid_12_13_14_registry_events/) | 40 | **Registry Events** — Rules that search key creation, value set and key rename together, because the technique can surface as any of the three. |

| [`eid_23_26_file_delete`](./eid_23_26_file_delete/) | 11 | **File Delete** — File deletion with archiving (23) and deletion detected without archiving (26) — anti-forensics and ransomware cleanup. |
| [`eid_27_28_29_file_block`](./eid_27_28_29_file_block/) | 3 | **File Block & Executable Detected** — Blocked executable writes (27), blocked file shredding (28) and executable file detection (29) — Sysmon acting as a preventive control. |
| [`multi_event`](./multi_event/) | 2 | **Multi-Event Rules** — Rules whose query spans more than one Sysmon event ID without matching one of the canonical event families above. |

## How a rule is filed

Placement is derived from the query itself, first match wins:

| # | Test on the rule's `search:` block | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `data_office365_*` fields, or an Office 365 `workload:` | the matching M365 workload folder |
| 2 | `data_process_exec_*` / `data_audit_*` fields | `tetragon` / `auditd` |
| 3 | PowerShell operational event ID 4103 or 4104 | `eid_4103_*` / `eid_4104_*` |
| 4 | query touches only Sysmon event IDs | `eid_<nn>_<event>` |
| 5 | `data_source` names a Windows channel | `security_` / `system_` / `application_eventlog`, `defender_`/`task_scheduler_operational` |
| 6 | matches on `full_log` / `rule_groups` only | `syslog` |
| 7 | web server fields | `web` |

Sysmon event IDs that form one logical family share a folder — **12/13/14** (registry),
**17/18** (named pipes), **19/20/21** (WMI subscriptions), **23/26** (file delete) and
**27/28/29** (file block). Rules routinely search all members of a family at once, so
splitting them per ID would file the same detection arbitrarily.

> **Note on folder names.** After flattening, Sysmon and PowerShell folders both start with
> `eid_`. Sysmon IDs are 1–29; PowerShell IDs are 4103 and 4104. The **Platform** and
> **Log source** line at the top of each folder README always states which product it is.

## Conventions

- One rule per file, filename in lowercase `snake_case` matching the rule's subject.
- Where two distinct rules (different `id:`) shared a filename, the one carrying a UUID `id:`
  keeps the plain name and the other gains an `_alt` suffix.
- Every folder has a generated `README.md` indexing its rules with severity, risk score and
  ATT&CK techniques.
- Rule schema is documented in [`../docs/SCHEMA.md`](../docs/SCHEMA.md).

## Adding a rule

1. Write the YAML against [`../docs/SCHEMA.md`](../docs/SCHEMA.md); copy a neighbour in the
   target folder to inherit its field naming and exclusion patterns.
2. File it by the routing table above — the folder must match what `search.query` reads.
3. Validate: `python src/detection_loader.py validate detections/<folder>/<rule>.yaml`
4. Regenerate the folder index so the rule appears in the table.
